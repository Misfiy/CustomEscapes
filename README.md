# Custom Escapes ![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/Misfiy/CustomEscapes/total)
* A plugin which allows full control over escapes.
* Disable base escapes, create your own
* Set a new location to escape at (only Surface / Pocket Dimension works), instead of the default
* Escape messages: Choose what is shown to the player when they escape

# Escape Simplified
* A very downed version, with less features.
* Change what roles can escape to what and what tickets to give.

# Support
* For any issues create an issue or contact me on [Discord](https://discord.gg/RYzahv3vfC).
* Also use the Discord for suggestions :)
